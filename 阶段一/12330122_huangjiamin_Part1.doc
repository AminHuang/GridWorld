North45Northeast90East135Southeast180South225Southwest270West315Northwest360North
2. Move a bug to a different location using the moveTo method. In which directions can you move it? How far can you move it? What happens if you try to move the bug outside the grid?
   Answer: All valid location in the grid can be moved. If I try to move the bug outside the grid, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.

3. Change the color of a bug, a flower, and a rock. Which method did you use?
   Answer: setColor method.

4. Move a rock on top of a bug and then move the rock again. What happened to the bug?
   Answer: When a rock is moved on top of a bug, the bug is covered by the rock,  you cannot see the bug in the grid. If the rock is moved again, the rock appears in the new location, but the bug does not be there or anywhere else in the grid any longer. That is, the bug is removed.
